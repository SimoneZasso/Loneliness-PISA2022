# Links between Loneliness, Math Anxiety, and Academic Achievement in 15-Year-Old Adolescents: A Latent Variable Analysis Using PISA 2022

This project investigates the relationship between loneliness, math anxiety, and math achievement among students. Using data from the PISA 2022 assessment, it employs Structural Equation Models to analyze the mediation role of math anxiety between loneliness and math achievement. Results reveal significant mediation effects across various countries, highlighting the important role of addressing psychosocial factors and a sense of loneliness in educational outcomes.
